# LLM-Based Fine-Tuning for Neologism Analysis

This project explores fine-tuning five different language models for **neologism sentiment analysis**. The trained models are integrated into an ensemble that powers a deployed application [here](https://7epirsk1nsii766kyug6kc4ctjxzlajj.vercel.app/).

## Overview
Neologisms, or newly coined words and expressions, present unique challenges in natural language processing (NLP). This project fine-tunes pre-trained language models to identify and analyze neologisms effectively. The models used in this study include:

1. **DistilBERT**
2. **GPT-2**
3. **RoBERTa**
4. **BERTweet**
5. 

## Ensemble Approach
Each model is trained individually on the neologism dataset and contributes to the final prediction in the deployed application. The ensemble aggregates outputs from all models to improve accuracy and robustness.
